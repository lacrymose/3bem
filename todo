** HOW TO TEST THE ELASTIC SOLVER SYSTEMATICALLY?

** should the displacement flip when the normal vector flips? i don't think so
** implement displacement boundary conditions
** vector direct_interact
** more systematic python loading/viewing
** make another script to produce interior displacements
** continue to work towards better bem
** gravity problem in plane strain -- valleys!
** do some profiling on the functions inside an iterative matrix solve
** consider a different way of handling constraints. precompute reduced matrix?
** link BEM to FMM
** load 3D problems
** a way of computing the condition number of a BEM matrix.

Longer term:
** do the same kernel checking for 2d elastic as 3d elastic
** stokes flow example
** higher order bases
** simple adaptive meshing
** faster near-field matrix construction
-- try the nearly singular tri rule =

** Improve compile times:
-- move templates into cpp files and librarify them 
--- vec.h, bem.h, etc
** template on double vs float?
