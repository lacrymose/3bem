CURRENT: MISC
** replace references to the kernel by unique_ptr to the kernel
** Clear out all "inline"
** move continuity builder stuff to cpp file
** consider moving all the general tbempy imports to within the TwoD, ThreeD dimension modules
** think about creating a python layer on top of the interop to isolate that layer and create a more pythonic interface

INTERNAL ARRAYS:
ideas:
** think about the memory management of array transfer between python and c++, when is copying necessary and when can just the data pointer be transferred? maybe copying is ideal to avoid premature optimization. if it ever becomes essential to avoid copying, deal with it then...
** vectorx should become numpy array in python
** consider getting rid of vectorx, or replacing with a facade over Eigen? or over numpy?
** See if I can turn vectorx into a numpy array wrapper. this would make python-c++ interop super smooth...

FMM SVD:
** replace the SVD used in the fmm code... use blas SVD, which allows use of fast
SVDs in things like MKL (once this is done, remove eigen dependency)

NEXT: hanging nodes 
** nearest_neighbors for point->triangle or triangle->triangle intersection
** Handle the general case when fault-surface intersection does not occur at a vertex.
-- Linked to hanging nodes in that lots of geometry code needs to be used/written.
-- (DD) Should I use CGAL or other comp-geom library (write a note on the decision)


FMM/NBODY SPEED:
** fix (figure out how to cause consistently) the occasional segfaults in the FMM.
** see how FMM accuracy changes as a function of
    1) radius of equivalent surface
    2) radius of check surface
    3) order of expansion
    4) multipole acceptance criteria
** move obs, src loop into the kernel functions which will reduce the number of
function calls and also allow sse/avx implementations of those kernel functions

INTEGRATION:
** finish up the sinh-sigmoidal work
** try using one shifted observation point globally rather than a different one for each local integral
** characterize the sinh-sigmoidal method
** crack-tip elements

BUILD:
** clean up the build system design
** test the build system on mac, a fresh ubuntu, odyssey/meade02, don't support windows

MISC/BORING:
** use iterators for traversing point sets?
** characterize the galerkin BEM for hypersingular kernels
** get rid of non-block operators and rename "Block___" to "___"

BASIS:
** better structure for dof maps -- stabilize that interface
** turn some of the stuff in basis and numerics into a "Basis" class
