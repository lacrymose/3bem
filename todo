** continue to work towards better bem
-- vector direct_interact and dof handling? 
** LMS problem
** gravity problem in plane strain -- valleys!
** link BEM to FMM
** design an input file format and load 2D/3D problems
** more systematic python loading/viewing
** some way of distinguishing files in the library for includes



Longer term:
** stokes flow example
** higher order bases
** simple adaptive meshing
** faster near-field matrix construction
-- try the nearly singular tri rule =

** Improve compile times:
-- move templates into cpp files and librarify them 
--- vec.h, bem.h, etc
** template on double vs float?
