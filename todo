four goals:
1. GET THE WEDGE MODELS WORKING CORRECTLY.
** fix failure of fault split algo for decelles
** try adaptivity with wedge.py

2. INTERIOR EVALUATION IMPROVEMENTS.
** investigate occasional interior evaluation failures
** start outlining the algorithm to take the meshed geometry and split space into regions with it
** interior meshing allowing beautiful interior plots
** identifying the interior from just the boundary
** make interior plotting easier

3. FASTER. CUT BY A FACTOR OF 10.
** remove constrained dofs
** the kernel work
** integral interpolation idea?

4. GENERAL PURPOSE ADAPTIVE MESHING.
** design a surface-based input system for elastic
** for 3D: hanging nodes should be relatively easy now that the facet-facet intersection algorithms work well
** acceptance test #2: adaptively refined okada solution (using the real error as the refinement criterion, so not technically adaptive meshing yet)

MISC:
** BUILTIN_FLOAT_DTYPE(16) in boost_numpy fails on odyssey
** logging in the c++ layer, how to integrate with logging in the python layer
** why do obs_far_order and obs_near_order need to be the same?
