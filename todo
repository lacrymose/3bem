** template on double vs float
** bug occurs when obs quad order != 2
** continue to work towards better bem
-- vector direct_interact
-- dof handling? 
-- Try out some adaptivity for the surface mesh
-- try the nearly singular tri rule = http://www98.griffith.edu.au/dspace/bitstream/handle/10072/54329/86520_1.pdf?sequence=1
** 3-10th order basis functions for solution and geometry
-- on triangles? how?
-- need nodal triangular basis -- the hesthaven electrostatics paper!
** Biggest time sink is the calculation of adjacent and identical element interactions
-- adaptive

** Improve compile times:
-- move templates into cpp files and librarify them 
--- vec.h, bem.h, etc
