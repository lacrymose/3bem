CURRENT: MISC
dependencies:
** git
** python2.7
** numpy
** scipy
** tar

** acceptance test: sparse ILU of near field matrix
** acceptance test: setup fmm operators for python wrapper
** finish setting up the elastic solver
** easy load/save for solved problems

** BUILTIN_FLOAT_DTYPE(16) in boost_numpy fails on odyssey

** automated build testing on mac, ubuntu, etc
** split out the fmm scheduler/traversal
** some simple capacity tests. how to make sure these run in the same conditions?
** operators should be just one double array
** move continuity builder stuff to cpp file
-- this may imply using a struct or redesigning the interface

KERNEL OVERHAUL
** replace references to the kernel by pointer to the kernel
** move obs, src loop into the kernel functions which will reduce the number of function calls and also allow sse/avx implementations of those kernel functions
template <size_t dim, size_t R, size_t C>
struct NewKernel {
    typedef std::vector<Vec<double,dim>> PtsType;
    typedef Vec<double,R> OutType;
    typedef Vec<double,C> InType;
    typedef Vec<Vec<double,C>,R> OperatorType;
    typedef std::function<OperatorType(PtType,PtType,NormalType,NormalType)> FncType;

    const static size_t n_rows = R;
    const static size_t n_cols = C;
    
    std::vector<OperatorType> 
    nbody_matrix(const NBodyData<dim>& data)
    {
        
    }

    std::vector<OutType> 
    nbody_eval(const NBodyData<dim>& data, const BlockVectorX& x)
    {
    
    }

    FncType internal;
};


NEXT: hanging nodes 
** nearest_neighbors for point->triangle or triangle->triangle intersection
** Handle the general case when fault-surface intersection does not occur at a vertex.
-- Linked to hanging nodes in that lots of geometry code needs to be used/written.
-- (DD) Should I use CGAL or other comp-geom library (write a note on the decision)

** see how FMM accuracy changes as a function of
    1) radius of equivalent surface
    2) radius of check surface
    3) order of expansion
    4) multipole acceptance criteria

INTEGRATION:
** finish up the sinh-sigmoidal work
** try using one shifted observation point globally rather than a different one for each local integral
** characterize the sinh-sigmoidal method
** crack-tip elements

BUILD:
** test the build system on a fresh ubuntu

MISC/BORING:
** use iterators for traversing point sets?
** characterize the galerkin BEM for hypersingular kernels
** get rid of non-block operators and rename "Block___" to "___"
