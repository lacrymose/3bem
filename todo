TOP PRIORITY (tasks until next merge with stable):
NF: Hanging nodes?
NF: Handle the general case when fault-surface intersection does not occur at a vertex.
---- Linked to hanging nodes in that lots of geometry code needs to be used/written.
---- (DD) Should I use CGAL or other comp-geom library (write a note on the decision)
NF: Link BEM to FMM

TESTS(T):
-- Set up a simple automatic way to confirm that each of the integration tests with a known analytic solution is checked against that solution

DESIGN DECISIONS(DD):
-- Consider a different way of handling constraints. Precomputing a reduced matrix and RHS? This would be useful for imposing boundary conditions.
-- Think about whether the "elastic" layer should be written in something besides c++
-- Decide whether to allow separating out individual rows or components of the tensor kernels. Adds complexity and a little bit of value, but the same thing can be achieved using the full tensor kernels and constraints. Is this true? If a different integral equation (traction vs. displacement) were used for the various rows, then constraints would not suffice. Interesting. Is there a way to easily build a tensor kernel out of a variety of components?

NEW FUNCTIONALITY(NF):
-- A way of computing the condition number of a BEM matrix.
-- Imagine some kind of general purpose "nearfield" structure that can allow a simple O(N) solution to the near neighbors problems in mesh_continuity, apply_discontinuities as well as the FMM tree structure.
-- DOF handling should be more systematic with a mesh_identifier, a face_id, a vertex_id, and a component_id for each dof_id. This needs a bidirectional mapping, especially for some of the constraints code. I should also account for the tensor/vector nature of certain fields. 
-- Once FMM-BEM integration is completed, a sparse matrix storage format should be used for the nearfield entries.
-- Slight encapsulation of the std::vector storage with useful things like negation, element-wise multiplication, etc. This might be useful to combine with a MeshField style field-over-mesh sitution.

MODIFIED FUNCTIONALITY(MF):

STRUCTURAL(S):
-- Restrict the main .h files to outward facing interfaces. Use _impl.h files for inward facing header files. Do this with constraints.h
-- KernelData object 
-- Pull some of vec.h out into a separate module "geometry.h"
-- Consider getting rid of autocheck as a dependency.
-- Can some decoupling be done so that individual pieces of direct_interact can be tested indepedently in unit tests rather than integration tests. Adaptive quadrature.
-- Make Box an immutable data type.
-- Make OctreeCell an immutable data type.
-- Within FMMInfo::P2M_helper: Extract P2M_cell_cell.
-- Within FMMInfo::L2P_helper: Extract this function as L2P_cell_cell.
-- The FMM code requires significant refactoring:(immutable data types, use a recurse and coalesce strategy for accumulating the jobs, get rid of the float_ variables, use a recurse and coalesce strategy for accumulating the multipoles and locals, make sure these modifications don't damage the efficiency, more uniform naming for global, cell-wise, node-wise operations in the FMM application)
-- Decoupling to allow testing individual pieces of the FMM algorithm.
-- Extract a get_box or get_single_pt_box function or both from the Octree::build_child function. In general, make that function more testable.
-- The min_code and max_code may not be necessary in OctreeCell except for construction.
-- Make Octree an immutable data type. 

OPTIMIZATION(O):
-- Some profiling on the functions inside an iterative matrix solve. I think a couple hours would get a factor of 5-10 here. Lots of inefficiencies. Low priority though.

LONG TERM:
** simple adaptive meshing! probably relatively low cost to implement, very high value!
** stokes flow example.
** higher order bases? is this worth the effort? medium-high cost, what is the value? be realistic.
** faster near-field matrix construction?
-- adaptive quadrature on a GPU or vectorized? is it possible?
-- try the nearly singular tri rule = http://www98.griffith.edu.au/dspace/bitstream/handle/10072/54329/86520_1.pdf?sequence=1
** python (mako, titen, etc) templating based solution for code generation? 
-- think about this more, write a note, positives? negatives? cost?
