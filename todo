CURRENT: Bug fixes and ease of use improvements while I work on elastic solver.
** hanging nodes!
** crack-tip elements
** characterize the galerkin BEM for hypersingular kernels
** characterize the sinh-sigmoidal method
** get rid of non-block operators and rename "Block___" to "___"
** Storing the kernel by reference in the integration methods is bad. fix.
** link the python via numpy
** include the boost python libraries with the code.
** Clear out all "inline"
** consider getting rid of vectorx
---------------------------------------

MILESTONE: HANGING NODES AND COMPLEX GEOMETRIES
S: Pull some of vec.h out into a separate module "geometry.h"
NF: Hanging nodes?
NF: Handle the general case when fault-surface intersection does not occur at a vertex.
---- Linked to hanging nodes in that lots of geometry code needs to be used/written.
---- (DD) Should I use CGAL or other comp-geom library (write a note on the decision)

---------------------------------------

MILESTONE: FMM-BEM INTEGRATION
DD: BIG: decide whether to use the direct FMM-based inversion methods.

NF: Imagine some kind of general purpose "nearfield" structure that can allow a simple O(N) solution to the near neighbors problems in mesh_continuity, apply_discontinuities as well as the FMM tree structure.
NF: FMM!
NF: Use the FMMOperator to perform an FMM evaluation within an iteration.
