completed tasks:
-refactoring of elastic solver, the code in the elastic solver is not really there yet and is a bit of a mess with all the logic of what to do with different types of input
-better logging for elastic solver
-function to determine which kernel/meshes each entry of the final matrix comes from
-discovered that real stress singularities probably occur in the wedge problem
-read a bunch of articles about common mistakes in mathematical modelling of elastic deformation -- mostly from a FEA perspective, but still applicable
-proof of concept for the interpolation approach to evaluating the inner integral
-implemented the remainder of the facet-facet intersection in order to effectively determine where a fault intersects a surface and cut the surface at that point
-implemented a proof of concept for adaptive mesh refinement using 3bem, mostly does not need to interact with the core code and can live on top
-determined what needs to be done to automate interior plotting
-thought about the problem of arrangements -- basically the block closure problem with extensions to 3D -- conclusion: meshing solves the problem
-thought about automated meshing software, all the good software has either GPL or restrictive licensing. going to go for it, but i'll keep a clear interface so that this can be replaced in the future. using triangle/tetgen
-working on creating the link to triangle/tetgen
-used a graph digitizer to get the geometry out of the decelles paper
-loading the decelles geometry and solving for displacement field for the wedge, realized that the fault-surface intersecting at a non-vertex stuff needs to be activated in the elastic solver before any of this will work
-determined that free slip elements were not being properly implemented. only one unconstrained 
-the way that BCs were being handled was not flexible enough to do it easily, so working on a better of BCs using constraints. Form the whole system assuming nothing is known, then form the RHS from the BCs
-fixed bugs in the same the linear systems were arranged. 
-got the row/column scaling to finally interact correctly with inhomogeneous constraints work correctly
