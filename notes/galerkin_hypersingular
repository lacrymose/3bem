the integral of the hypersingular kernel over an isolated element has
singularities at the end points of the element. this means that the galerkin
integral may not converge. but, these singularities will cancel with 
singularities on the adjacent elements. 

as a result:
the hypersingular galerkin formulation is only valid when continuity is imposed
between the unknown displacement fields on neighboring elements. this is simple
for the BCs -- they should already be continuous. for a simple traction BC 
element, it is also simple, just impose continuity. at a displacement/traction
corner, the single DOF at the end of the traction BC element must be constrained
by the displacement BC at the corner. also, i think the displacement 
discontinuity should be continuous -- i am not currently doing this. try it!
