openmp libraries

compiler:
compiling with g++ (gnu) is good
compiling with icpc (intel) is good
compiling with clang++ may fail due to lack of openmp libraries, unless a gcc installation is also present, in which case the installation will be single-threaded

to install on mac needed:
CXX=g++-4.9 python unit_tests/setup.py
