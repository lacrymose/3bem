openmp libraries

compiler:
compiling with g++ (gnu) is good
compiling with icpc (intel) is good
compiling with clang++ may fail due to lack of openmp libraries, unless a gcc installation is also present, in which case the installation will be single-threaded

installing gcc using homebrew need "--without-multilib" to enable OpenMP

to install on mac needed:
CC=gcc-4.9 CXX=g++-4.9 CFLAGS="" OPT="" python unit_tests/setup.py
