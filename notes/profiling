perf stat gives info on branch prediction successes.
perf record gives some info on where time was spent using sampling
perf report shows that info
oprofile also does a decent job
zoom is a more advanced profiler with a gui etc
using gdb plus interupting the running process occassionally is very easy and
highly effective

pmu-tools toplev.py is great. use it.
