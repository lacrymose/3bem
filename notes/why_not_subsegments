I had the idea that I could globally discretize an integral and then split
it up into subsegments surrounding each quadrature point. When those subsegs
are close to the observation point, I would further refine them. However, 
this ignores that high order (Gauss, etc..) quadrature rules are in fact
global operations and removing a section of the integral and evaluating it
more accurately results in a large error. This should have been obvious. 
Otherwise, adaptive quadrature would be trivial.
