use std::thread to parallelize the octree construction
make sure that no copying is incurred by the multithreaded version
-- use pointers and std::move or something like that
play with avx or sse a bit
think about how i would do this in the case of a actor-style concurrency model

template out the element type of the Octree
onwards to upwards traversal and then a treecode
