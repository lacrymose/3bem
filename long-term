- Three-dimensional variations in material poperties. Two ways to implement:
-- Multiple subdomains with boundaries. Simpler when the elastic structure has a small number of components
-- Smooth volumetric variations -- treat this as a body force and integrate volumetrically. Possibly simpler when the elastic structure is very complex.


- Linear viscoelasticity. Two possible ways to implement:
-- Correspondence priniciple
--- how many different elastic problems does an inverse Laplace transform code require to handle on
-- Body forces 
--- more general, could be applied to plasticity or dynamic wave propagation, 
--- more difficult to code


- Stokes flow example.
-- Requires nothing that isn't already implemented!

- Methods for solving the inverse problem. Many many different ways of posing the problem. 


- A tool for determining memory requirements and approximate run times for a given set of input files. Runs a simple problem to benchmark the current machine's capabilities and then extrapolates to whatever the problem is.


- Simple adaptive meshing! probably relatively low cost to implement, very high value!
-- One of the primary difficulties in traditional FEM is hanging nodes. I intend to handle hanging nodes anyway because meshing is much more difficult if they are forbidden.
-- Remaining difficulty is to find a good error estimator. 
-- Use the formulation from the "SGBEM" book.


- Higher order bases? is this worth the effort? medium-high cost, what is the value? be realistic.
-- Probably not useful for static elastic problems. Adaptive meshing would be more useful. 
-- Key problem is that the surface shape has to be parameterized to the same accuracy as the field of interest, otherwise the 
-- I suspect higher order would be very useful for volumetric problems/body forces, where surface shape does not need to be parameterized so heavily.
-- I'm not convinced it would be that difficult once a better DOF handling solution is in place. 


- Faster near-field matrix construction? Once FMM-BEM integration is implemented, this will be the main bottleneck for solving large problems.
-- adaptive quadrature on a GPU or vectorized? is it possible?
-- Using vector instructions is difficult because it reduces portability and breaks standard design barrier, interface should be agnostic to implementation.
-- try the nearly singular tri rule = http://www98.griffith.edu.au/dspace/bitstream/handle/10072/54329/86520_1.pdf?sequence=1
-- Templating (mako, titen, etc) based solution for code generation of highly efficient core chunks of code? 
--- think about this more, write a note, positives? negatives? cost?
