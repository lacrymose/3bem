This is a work in progress on some coding standards for 3bem.

Variables and functions are written in underscore notation:
a_variable, do_something()

Classes are CamelCase.

Test first, implement second.

Some things can only really be tested in a large-scale "integration test" that
solves a full problem. This is okay, but try to avoid it.

Use nouns for variable names and class names

verbs for function names

Names should be descriptive

Functions should be short -- <20 lines

Documentation should be in header files.

Read "Clean Code"
